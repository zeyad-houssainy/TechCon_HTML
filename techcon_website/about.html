                <p>
                    TechCon began in 2018, born from a small group's vision to create a vibrant community for tech enthusiasts. What started as a modest local meetup quickly blossomed, driven by a shared passion for innovation and knowledge exchange.
                    Over the years, TechCon has expanded dramatically, adapting to the fast-paced technological landscape. We've consistently embraced diverse voices and cutting-edge ideas, growing from a regional gathering into a premier event that continues to shape the future of technology discussions.
